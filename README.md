 AI Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of several fundamental algorithms in Artificial Intelligence, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Tic-Tac-Toe, and Hill Climbing. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and accompanied by comments to help you understand the code.
This repository is designed for anyone interested in learning about and experimenting with classic AI algorithms. Whether you're a student, educator, or AI enthusiast, these implementations will help you understand the core concepts and practical applications of these algorithms.

Algorithms

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
