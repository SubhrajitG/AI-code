## AI CODES

This repository contains implementations of several fundamental algorithms in Artificial Intelligence, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Tic-Tac-Toe, and Hill Climbing and A*(A-Star). Each algorithm is implemented in Python and accompanied by comments to help you understand the code.
This repository is designed for anyone interested in learning about and experimenting with classic AI algorithms. Whether you're a student, educator, or AI enthusiast, these implementations will help you understand the core concepts and practical applications of these algorithms.

Algorithms

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to place three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before your opponent does.

Hill Climbing

Hill Climbing is an optimization algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem and iteratively makes small changes to the solution, each time improving it.

A* (A Star)

A* (A Star) is a widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is known for its efficiency and accuracy in finding the shortest path between nodes, using heuristics to guide its search.
